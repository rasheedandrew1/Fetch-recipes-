### Focus Areas: 
     I focused more on the backend of the application. I focused on the architecture pattern of the application. I amde sure to use the MVVM pattern. I implemented dependency injection to pass functions from a class to another from an initializer instead of using singletons. I used protocols to support the dependency injections. I wrote test cases to support the logics in the viewModels. 

### Time Spent: 
     Approximately 10 to 15hours

### Trade-offs and Decisions: 
     Not really. I didn't write tests for the UI.

### Weakest Part of the Project: 
     I would say the test cases. I believe I can improve on some of the logic for the test cases.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
